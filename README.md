# Load-Flow
The repository contains MATLAB code for performing Newton-Raphson load flow of a general power system. To demonstrate its working, a five-bus system is considered in the program. Moreover, the required functions are attached. Symbolic expressions for the power and Jacobian are obtained and evaluated in the program. 
Please feel free for suggesting the ways to improve the time-efficiency of the algorithm.
